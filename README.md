# Robot-Arm-Coordination

The DKE SwarmLab is coordinating a large-scale European project that aims at 
securing environmentally friendly, sustainable food. Part of this work involves the automated 
manipulation (e.g., sorting, lifting, dragging across a surface) of small objects with a robotic 
arm. In order for the arm to operate autonomously and properly grasp/manipulate objects, 
it must be able to identify them (e.g., using cameras or scanners), locate them in a local frame 
of reference, identify a proper grip (e.g., using computer vision), and plan a path accordingly 
while avoiding collisions. For this project, you will research and investigate 3D robotic vision 
and simulate the robot arm to perform simple manipulation tasks based on visual input and 
control techniques.
